# Megaplan Setup

Three dials decide how to run a sprint:

| | Question | Dial | What it scales | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | How model-quality-sensitive is the planning loop? | **Overall plan difficulty** | model quality for plan/revise/finalize | `--profile partnered-3|partnered-4|partnered-5` |
| 2 | What level of process rigor does this need? | **Planning complexity** | `# of calls` | `--robustness` |
| 3 | How deeply does each model need to think? | **Depth** | `tokens/call` | `--depth` (with `--phase-model` as the surgical escape hatch) |

**Always run a megaplan, even for tiny work.** The harness captures the brief, plan, execution, and outcome — that record is worth the few seconds of overhead. `bare` is the floor; there is no "skip megaplan" option.

**Run megaplan inside a subagent by default**, off the main thread — keeping the orchestrating conversation thin while the harness handles its own multi-phase chatter. On-thread is the exception, reserved for when you want to watch each phase live. The subagent is the venue; megaplan is still the harness — never skip megaplan in favor of "just doing it in a subagent."

The dials are independent — work through each one ignoring the others — then weigh the three together holistically. A high tier with low robustness is usually a mismatch; so is a low tier with `max` depth. When the three pull in opposite directions, the work probably needs to be split.

**The dials measure residual complexity, not nominal scope.** Discount for decisions already made; add for unknowns remaining. A spec-shaped brief with everything known lands a tier lower than the same nominal scope arriving as a sketch.

**Defaults to keep in mind:** score the run first; use `--profile partnered-3 --vendor codex` for overall plan difficulty 1–3, `partnered-4` for 4, and `partnered-5` for 5. Keep `--robustness full` and `--depth` unset unless you can name the specific reason to change them. Built-in profiles live in `megaplan/profiles/`; per-user (`~/.config/megaplan/profiles.toml`) and per-project (`<project>/.megaplan/profiles.toml`) TOML overrides win over them.

---

## Sizing and briefing

Two decisions come before the three dials: **how many megaplans you need**, and **what each brief covers**. Get these wrong and the dials can't save the run.

### Size each megaplan to ~2 weeks of work

A megaplan should fit roughly **two weeks of human work** — the time a skilled engineer would take to plan, build, and review the same scope. Wall-clock for the harness itself is unrelated; this is about scope, not duration.

If the work is bigger, **split it into an epic** — a chain of sprint-sized megaplans driven sequentially by `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan chain`. Each sprint in the chain gets its own brief, its own overall plan difficulty score, its own profile, and its own retrospective. See the **megaplan-epic** skill for spec format, per-milestone rubric, and end-to-end usage. Cramming a month of work into one plan means the brief drifts, the critique loses focus, and the review can't hold the whole shape in one pass.

Signs you should split:

- Multiple major architectural decisions — each deserves its own sprint.
- Deliverables with different stakes — high-stakes infra warrants its own sprint, at a higher tier; bundling it with cheap work either over-pays for the cheap work or under-protects the expensive part.
- You can't describe the outcome in one or two sentences.

When you split, structure the dependency graph explicitly. Each handoff is a written artifact — schema, API surface, doc — that the next brief can cite. Sprints without that artifact between them are really one sprint pretending to be two.

**But: one profile per sprint.** Within a sprint, score the overall planning difficulty for the sprint as a whole. Operational simplicity beats the savings from splitting by difficulty alone. Only split when lower-difficulty work is *substantial* (multiple days) **and** independent. Structure the plan so easier work lives in easier sprints, not interleaved inside harder ones.

### What goes in the brief

**Tightening the brief beats picking a higher tier** — and is usually cheaper. Invest here before anywhere else.

**The brief must be locked in before init** — fully self-contained so the model can run end-to-end without coming back for clarification. The harness snapshots the brief at `init`; later edits to the idea-file are not re-read. If you find yourself wanting to "ask the model" what to do, write that decision down first.

**Store durable briefs in `.megaplan/initiatives/<slug>/`.** Single-plan ideas live at `.megaplan/initiatives/<slug>/briefs/<slug>.md`. Epics live at `.megaplan/initiatives/<epic-slug>/chain.yaml` with milestone briefs under `briefs/`. `.megaplan/plans/` is generated run state; `.megaplan/initiatives/` is the committed input material you hand to `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init` or `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan chain start`. Use `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan brief new` or `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan brief epic` to create the canonical files.

A good brief covers:

1. **Outcome** — what's being delivered, in one or two sentences. The thing a reviewer would check.
2. **Scope** — what's IN, what's OUT, sized to ≤2 weeks of work.
3. **Locked decisions** — architecture, interfaces, libraries, patterns already chosen. Naming them stops the planner from relitigating.
4. **Open questions** — things you don't know yet that the planner needs to resolve. Naming them stops the planner from quietly inventing answers.
5. **Constraints** — performance budgets, security requirements, backward-compat needs, deadlines.
6. **Done criteria** — what "done" looks like: a test that passes, a workflow that completes, a metric below a threshold.
7. **Touchpoints** — which files / modules / surfaces the work touches.
8. **Anti-scope** — explicit "don't touch X" or "don't refactor Y" so the planner doesn't drift into bonus work.

A brief missing #3 or #4 surfaces those gaps as critique flags — better to write them down up front than have the harness rediscover them mid-run.

## Dial 1 — Overall Plan Difficulty

> **"How model-quality-sensitive is the planning/revision/adjudication loop?"**

Score the whole plan's residual difficulty from **1 to 5** before choosing the profile. This is not the same as per-task execution complexity (which is now scored 1-10 for model routing in `tier_models.execute`): the plan dial decides how strong the planning/revision/adjudication loop should be for the run as a whole. Task execution complexity is adjudicated in finalize and routes batches via the 1-10 execute tier ladder.

The score is intentionally more granular than the profile map: scores `1`, `2`, and `3` all use `partnered-3`. The extra resolution is for auditability and repeatability, not fake precision. Only move to `partnered-4` or `partnered-5` when the plan itself is model-quality-sensitive.

| Score | Profile | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | `partnered-3` | Small, local, well-specified work with obvious files and tests. |
| `2` | `partnered-3` | Moderate implementation where patterns are known and failure is easy to detect. |
| `3` | `partnered-3` | Default for real engineering work: some judgment calls, but no unusually hard architecture or validation problem. |
| `4` | `partnered-4` | Hard planning or decomposition: unfamiliar code, cross-system behavior, subtle ordering, import/package topology, or a difficult task-difficulty adjudication problem. |
| `5` | `partnered-5` | Highest-stakes or hardest plans: architecture pivots, production data, security, public contracts, migrations, or failures that could pass tests while causing non-local damage. |

Use these guardrails:

- Do not upscore for size alone. Large repetitive work should split into an epic, raise `--robustness`, or cap execution spend; it should not become `partnered-5` just because there are many edits.
- Raise to `4` for package moves, import graph changes, public re-exports, shared initialization paths, dependency inversion, or other topology work, even when the desired behavior is unchanged.
- Use `5` when a bad plan could still pass local tests while damaging a contract, invariant, migration path, data model, security boundary, or downstream architecture.
- Score the highest plausible planning failure, not the scariest noun. Production data, auth, or schemas do not automatically mean `5` if the actual change is local and well-proven.

When genuinely torn between two scores, choose the lower score and raise `--depth` or `--robustness` first, unless the specific risk is bad task decomposition, bad task-difficulty adjudication, or a bad architecture choice. Those are profile-selection risks.

Use the dials separately:

- Unclear requirements or missing context -> `--with-prep` or higher `--robustness`.
- Need more deliberation from the same planner -> higher `--depth`.
- Need a better model for decomposition/adjudication/architecture -> higher profile.

Always record the choice in the prep output:

```text
Overall plan difficulty: N/5; selected profile: partnered-3|partnered-4|partnered-5; because: <one sentence naming the planning failure being guarded against>.
```

---

## Dial 2 — Planning complexity

> **"What level of process rigor does this need?"**

The `--robustness` flag. Picks how many phases run and how many critique passes happen. The five levels form a coherent process-completeness scale: **bare → light → full → thorough → extreme**.

| Setting | Workflow | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `bare` | plan → finalize → execute (no prep, no critique, no gate, no review) | **The floor — use this when nothing heavier earns its cost.** Single-file fixes, mechanical changes, tasks you'd otherwise do inline. The 3-phase run captures what you did and why, even when critique would be a no-op. Always preferable to skipping the harness. |
| `light` | plan → critique → revise → finalize → execute (no prep, no gate, no review) | Small/scoped, well-known feature, low blast radius — but you want **one** sense-check pass on the plan before committing. ~5 phases instead of 8. |
| `full` *(default)* | prep → plan → critique → gate → revise → finalize → execute → review; up to 6 critique lenses | Cross-cutting, unfamiliar code, ambiguous brief. **This is almost always perfect for everything.** |
| `thorough` | Same shape as `full`, up to 9 critique lenses + parallel critique | Security, data migration, public API contract — anything where a regression = production incident. **Extremely rare.** You should be able to name the specific stakes that warrant it. |
| `extreme` | `thorough` + parallel review | Both deep critique *and* concurrent review matter. **Vanishingly rare.** Only when the user specifically asks for it. |

Cost scales ~1.5-2× from `light` → `full`, another ~1.3× to `thorough`.

The "critique lenses" counts above are the **static** lens pools used when adaptive critique is **off**. When adaptive critique is **on**, the evaluator selects which lenses fire from the same 9-lens catalog per iteration — the robustness dial no longer fixes a count; the evaluator does (see [`docs/critique.md`](critique.md)). Robustness still governs the surrounding workflow shape (whether `gate`/`review` run, whether prep/parallel critique are forced).

---

## Dial 3 — Depth

> **"How deeply does each model need to think within the tier I picked?"**

Picks the thinking strength of the premium model(s) the tier brought in. Independent of tier and robustness — orthogonal lever. Spelled out in the agent spec after a colon (`claude:low`, `codex:medium`, etc.).

| Pattern | When to use |
|---|---|
| `low` planner / `low` critic | **The default.** The pattern is mechanical, intuition is enough, the codebase is well-known. A lot of work lands here even at tier 3 — premium models at `low` thinking are still substantially smarter than DeepSeek, so the upgrade isn't free but doesn't need to be expensive either. |
| `medium` planner / `low` critic | Brief is clear but the work has real judgment calls. The plan needs deliberation beyond intuition; the critic still doesn't. |
| `high` planner / `low` critic | Brief is long OR codebase is unfamiliar. The planner needs substantial repo-reading and structural reasoning. |
| `xhigh` / `max` planner only | Genuinely novel architectural decision. Use sparingly — most "hard" plans don't actually need this. |

Available strengths: Claude is `low / medium / high / xhigh / max`; Codex is `minimal / low / medium / high`.

**The asymmetry principle:** author phases (plan, revise) can scale all the way up to `max` when the work demands deliberation; sense-check phases (critique, gate, review) plateau at `low` regardless of stakes. A `claude:high` planner + `claude:low` critic is the right shape when the plan needs real thinking — not `claude:medium` everywhere.

Default to `low`; only spend on depth when you can name the specific reason the planner needs to deliberate. "Just in case" doesn't earn the cost.

---

## When the dials turn out wrong — mid-flight escalation

**If a run is struggling, escalate mid-flight rather than letting it grind.** Common signals: the plan keeps missing concerns critique surfaces; revise doesn't resolve the critique's flags; the executor produces work review can't accept; iteration cycles through the same defects without converging. Don't sit through a degenerate run — one wasted phase costs much less than restarting the sprint.

- `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan override set-profile --profile NAME --plan ID` — swap profile mid-run. Started on `partnered-3`, hit something gnarlier, escalate to `partnered-4` or `partnered-5` for the remainder.
- `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan override set-robustness --robustness LEVEL --plan ID` — same for the planning-complexity dial.
- `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan override replan --plan ID` — back up to planning and redo with whatever models / robustness are now active.
- `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan override add-note --plan ID --note "..."` — inject guidance into an active plan without restarting any phase. Read by every subsequent phase. The brief is snapshotted at `init`; later edits to the idea-file are NOT re-read, so this is the verb for "I missed something." **`python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan feedback` is end-of-run rating, not in-flight guidance** — common confusion.

Lean on these instead of inventing more profile names. If you find yourself thinking "I want a profile that's *like* `partnered-3` but with X" — the answer is usually `partnered-3` plus an override, unless it matches the explicit `partnered-4` or `partnered-5` rubric above.

---

## Optional phases (`--with-prep`, `--with-feedback`)

Two narrower levers orthogonal to the three dials. Both off by default.

### Prep (`--with-prep`)

> **"Does the planner need to do explicit research before it can commit to a plan?"**

`prep` is a visible research phase that runs *before* `plan` — the planner explicitly reads external docs, surveys an unfamiliar library, maps an API surface, or disambiguates a vague brief. Enable with `--with-prep`.

**Reach for it when at least one of these is true:**

- **External APIs whose semantics aren't already known** — the planner has to read API docs before deciding what calls to make.
- **Unfamiliar libraries or frameworks** — codebase patterns aren't enough; the planner needs to survey the library's API surface first.
- **Research-heavy briefs** — the work is research-bounded ("figure out how X behaves, then implement").
- **Ambiguous or under-specified requirements** — the planner needs a budget to disambiguate explicitly instead of interleaving with planning.
- **Integration work where target-system behavior must be discovered** — wire formats, error semantics, performance characteristics undocumented in the codebase.

"Prep just in case" doesn't earn its cost. Redundant at `thorough` and `extreme` (those already include prep); the flag's value is at `light` and `full`, where prep is normally skipped.

**Steering prep with `--prep-direction`.** When prep runs (either via `--with-prep` or because robustness is `thorough`/`extreme`), you can hand it explicit guidance about *what* to explore: `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init … --prep-direction "focus on the worker shutdown path; ignore CLI plumbing"`. It's shown to the prep worker as a distinct "User direction for prep" section — steering, not a replacement for the task. Use it when prep would otherwise wander (broad codebase, multiple plausible entry points) or when you want it to skip the obvious file and trace a specific call chain. You can also set or replace it after init with `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan prep --direction "…"` before the phase runs, and chain milestones accept `prep_direction:` per milestone. Has no effect if prep is skipped.

### Feedback (`--with-feedback`)

> **"Do you want a per-stage ratings template waiting on disk when the run finishes?"**

`--with-feedback` adds a `feedback` step between `review` and `done` that scaffolds `feedback.md` (a per-stage ratings template) and then completes the plan. Enable with `--with-feedback`.

**Reach for it when at least one of these is true:**

- **You're uncertain whether enough model was used** — there's real ambiguity about whether the tier choice was right, and you want a per-stage record that lets you go back and decide whether to step up (or down) next time.
- **The user specifically requests it.**

The auto driver runs this non-interactively — never blocks on human input, never opens `$EDITOR`. The file is just left on disk. The user fills in `feedback.md` afterward (or ignores it — no reminders, no prompts).

"Feedback just in case" doesn't earn its cost. The template exists to be used; if nobody is going to rate the run, skip the flag.

---

## Notation

Write `profile/robustness/depth`, omit defaults, append modifiers. Order is fixed left-to-right: tier → robustness → depth, matching dial numbers 1 → 2 → 3. The `//` reads as "skip the middle slot — defaults there."

| Shorthand | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `partnered-3` | Overall plan difficulty 1–3, defaults throughout |
| `partnered-4//high` | Overall plan difficulty 4, high depth, default robustness |
| `partnered-3//high @codex +prep` | Overall plan difficulty 1–3, high depth, codex vendor, with prep phase |
| `partnered-5/thorough/high` | Overall plan difficulty 5, thorough, high depth |

Modifier conventions: `@<vendor>` for vendor override, `, critic=<kind>` for critic override, `+prep` to enable prep, `+feedback` to enable feedback. Append modifiers without disturbing the spine.

The shorthand is for recording (sprint notes, brief headers, commit messages), not for the CLI. The actual invocation is still `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init --profile … --robustness … --depth …` — see "Running it" below.

---

## Running it — profile plus the knobs

The invocation has three layers: three flags for the dials, four modifiers for orthogonal toggles, one escape hatch for surgical needs.

### The three dial flags

1. **`--profile`** — `partnered-3`, `partnered-4`, or `partnered-5`, chosen from the overall plan difficulty score.
2. **`--robustness bare|light|full|thorough|extreme`** — `full` is home base.
3. **`--depth low|medium|high|xhigh|max`** — rewrites the effort suffix on author-side claude/codex slots (plan, revise, loop_plan, tiebreaker_*) at the resolved vendor. Critic + mechanical phases plateau at their existing depth (the asymmetry principle). Defaults to whatever the profile sets (usually `:low`). Honored on vendor-locked profiles. Codex caps at `high`; Claude adds `xhigh` and `max`.

### The modifier flags

- **`--vendor claude|codex`** — vendor override where the selected profile exposes premium vendor slots. Defaults to `[defaults].vendor` in `~/.config/megaplan/config.toml` (or `claude` if unset).
- **`--critic cross`** — overrides the critique+review pair to the other premium vendor relative to `--vendor`, when supported by the selected profile.
- **`--deepseek-provider direct`** — keeps canonical DeepSeek v4-pro slots on DeepSeek's direct API. Defaults to `direct`; Fireworks is not a supported DeepSeek route.
- **`--with-prep`** — force the `prep` research phase into the workflow regardless of `--robustness`. Off by default; no-op at `thorough`/`extreme`. See "Optional phases" above.
- **`--prep-direction "…"`** — steering text shown to the prep worker (when prep runs) as a "User direction for prep" section. Points prep at specific files / subsystems / questions to explore. Can also be set or replaced later with `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan prep --direction "…"` before the phase runs. No-op if prep is skipped. See "Optional phases" above.
- **`--with-feedback`** — force the `feedback` phase into the workflow regardless of `--robustness`. Scaffolds `feedback.md` (a per-stage ratings template) between `review` and `done`, then completes the plan non-interactively. Off by default. See "Optional phases" above.

### The escape hatch

**`--phase-model phase=spec`**, repeatable. For when `--depth` is too coarse — e.g. bump just `critique` without touching the rest. Most runs don't need it.

For an in-flight plan, `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan override set-model --phase PHASE --model MODEL`
updates that phase's persisted `phase_model` entry. If you are switching premium
vendors, pass a full premium spec such as `--model claude:sonnet` or
`--model codex:gpt-5.5`; passing only `--model sonnet` keeps the phase's
currently inferred premium agent and changes only its model token.

**Fallback chains via profile TOML arrays.** Profile TOML phase values can be
string arrays (e.g., `plan = ["claude", "codex"]`) to declare an ordered
fallback chain — see the **Profiles > Fallback chains (v1)** section in the main
megaplan skill. TOML arrays are the only v1 entry point for fallback chains;
there is no comma syntax, CLI fallback-list flag, or YAML chain editing in v1.
`override set-model` replaces an encoded chain with a scalar selected spec
in v1.

Important: `--phase-model critique=...` and `override set-model --phase critique`
pin the critique **phase/orchestrator**. They do not by themselves pin the
per-lens critics chosen by adaptive critique. In the normal adaptive path, a
premium evaluator/director may run first and then dispatch the selected critique
lenses to cheaper DeepSeek/Kimi-style workers; seeing `critique_evaluator` on a
premium model followed by `critique` on Hermes/DeepSeek is expected. Only pin
`execution.critic_model` when you intentionally want to override that adaptive
critic-worker routing.

### The critique == review invariant

The model that critiques the plan also reviews the executed work — same mind pre-execution and post-execution. Wiring them to the same non-author model gives you one coherent second mind across both checkpoints and keeps the author's blindspots out of the sense-check loop.

`--critic` bundles the two phases in one flag and preserves the invariant. Bare `--phase-model` does not — if you override critique with `--phase-model`, override review the same way, or use `--critic` instead.

**Exception — `partnered-*`:** critique may run on cheap DeepSeek under the premium *critique-evaluator's* direction (adaptive critique is on by default), while review stays premium. The premium **director** — not a strict same-model invariant — is what keeps the critique phase honest: the evaluator picks the lenses the cheap critic runs and rejects weak findings, so you get premium-grade critique judgment without paying for a premium critic model on every lens.

### Worktree isolation — `--in-worktree`

`python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init --in-worktree NAME` spins up a dedicated git worktree at `~/Documents/.megaplan-worktrees/<NAME>/` on a new branch, so each sprint lives in its own checkout. Use it for multi-PR migrations, or when concurrent work on `main` shouldn't be disturbed. Substitutes for `--project-dir`.

- **`--worktree-from GITREF`** — fork from a specific branch/tag/SHA instead of `HEAD`.
- **`--clean-worktree`** — fork from a clean base. By default, uncommitted state in the invoking repo is replicated into the new worktree (the source repo's working tree is never touched).

Safe to use: never runs stash/checkout/reset against the source, refuses on busy repo states (mid-rebase/merge/cherry-pick/bisect) and name collisions, atomic on failure.

Skip `--in-worktree` for small one-shot plans, bakeoff runs (orchestrator manages its own worktrees), or when extending an existing worktree (use `--project-dir <path>` instead).

### Worked invocations

> *"Schema migration, step ordering intricate but each step mechanical."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-3`

> *"Novel cross-cutting feature, long brief, unfamiliar codebase."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-4 --depth high`

> *"Novel feature against an external API we haven't used."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-3 --with-prep`

> *"Migration logic against production data."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-5 --robustness thorough --depth high`

> *"Schema everyone downstream will build on — concurrency primitive, cascading consequences."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-5 --robustness thorough --depth high`

> *"Tier 3, brief is clear, but I want the critic specifically to deliberate more — leave the planner alone."*
> `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan init <brief> --profile partnered-3 --phase-model critique=claude:medium --phase-model review=claude:medium` *(surgical: bumps just the critic+review pair — preserving the critique==review invariant — and leaves plan/revise at the profile's default. `--depth` can't express this because it's by-phase-name, not by-author-vs-critic.)*

Three pieces of intent → three flags (`--profile`, `--robustness`, `--depth`), plus `--vendor` / `--critic` / `--with-prep` / `--with-feedback` / `--in-worktree` when you need them.

### Config defaults

The `--vendor` flag honors a per-user config default. Write `~/.config/megaplan/config.toml`:

```toml
[defaults]
vendor = "claude"   # "claude" or "codex"
```

Set this once on a new machine and supported premium slots default to your preferred vendor without per-invocation flags. The CLI flag still wins when passed. A malformed or missing config falls back to `claude` silently.

---

## Bake-off

Default to a single profile. Only run a multi-arm bake-off when (a) the user asks, (b) three or more mixes are genuinely plausible, (c) the deliverable is a diff worth comparing, and (d) per-arm cost is well below the cost of guessing wrong. Don't bake off discovery / scoping / contract-freeze sprints — no diff to compare.

---

## Watching and diagnosing a running plan

This skill covers profile/robustness/depth selection *before* a run. Once a plan is in flight, switch to the **`megaplan-observe`** skill — same author, complementary focus:

- **Pull-mode observation**: `python -m arnold_pipelines.megaplan introspect` / `trace` / `doctor` for on-demand inspection, blockage diagnosis, drift detection. Read it before reaching for `override` so you don't guess at an `invalid_transition`.
- **Push-mode observation**: `watcher.sh` (bundled in the same skill) is a bash polling loop that streams phase-transition notifications. Wire it through Claude Code's `Monitor` tool to get told when phases start/end, when cost climbs, and when the plan reaches a terminal state — no manual polling.

When something looks wrong during a run (cost spiking, phase not advancing, iteration counter stuck), `megaplan-observe` is the next stop, not `--max-cost-usd`. The cost-cap and rework-cap flags exist for narrow recovery cases; they are not a default. Trust the defaults; intervene with `override` + tests if a phase fixates.
